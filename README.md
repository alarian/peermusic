## Features

<a href=https://github.com/pguth/Ethical-Design-Manifesto><img src=https://ind.ie/ethical-design/images/ethical-design-badge-small.svg align=right alt="We strive to practice Ethical Design." /></a>

- [x] Runs in your browser tab.
- [x] Data is only shared with Peermusic instances that got deliberately connected by the user.
- [x] The music player is a single-page applications that can run offline.
- [x] Requires minimal server infrastructure:
  - (required) A [signalhub server](https://github.com/mafintosh/signalhub) via which instances can initiate their peer-to-peer connections.
  - (optional) A [metadata providing server](https://github.com/peermusic/node-scraping-server) that delivers cover art and information about similarity of songs.
- [x] Features a beautiful mobile ready interface with different themes for every taste.
- [x] Connects peer-to-peer between instances to share data.
- [x] Secures the communication cryptographically (regular WebRTC encryption - no public key pinning).
- [x] Does not leak IP information to the central signalhub server that faciliates the peer-to-peer connection setup.
- [x] Gossips the index of available music between all (directly or indirectly) connected instances.
  - Over time every instance will know about all songs that other (directly or indirectly) connected instances hold.
- [x] Facilitates music sharing via an escrow concept:
  - A asks B which in turn asks C which holds the requested file.
  - B downloads from C and then A downloads from B.
- [x] Different sharing levels are avaliable:
  - `leech` and `private` only connect to the users own Peermusic instances.
  - `everyone` takes advantage of [WebTorrent](https://github.com/feross/webtorrent):
    - Locally available songs will be seeded via WebTorrent.
    - Locally unavailable songs that are requested by other instances will be downloaded via WebTorrent.
- [x] Metadata about songs is gossiped between all (directly or indirectly) connected instances.
- [x] Playlists can be autogenerated using information about similarity provided by the metadata providing server mentioned above or by connected instances.
- [x] Works with Google Chrome and Chromium on desktop and mobile plattforms.
- [x] *Peermusic can easily be self hosted.*


## Install

*You can find the most recent version here: [Peermusic hosted on Github Pages](http://peermusic.github.io/).*

```sh
git clone https://github.com/peermusic/app.git
cd peermusic
npm install -g gulp
npm install
gulp
```

A local webserver will be started on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). A file watcher will automatically recompiled when source files are beeing changed. The generated files will be placed in `public/build/`.

Also a local signalhub server will be started on `localhost:7000` to allow for easy testing of the peer-to-peer features. To run a different instance of Peermusic within the same browser use [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:7000).

If you have [livereload](http://livereload.com/extensions/) installed browser reloads will be triggered automatically on code changes.
